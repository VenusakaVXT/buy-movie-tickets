# Buy Movie Tickets (BMT)
<div text-align="justify">
This is the project that I did for software project 1, 2 and my scientific research project at school. As the name of the product suggests, the topic I chose to research and implement is called: "Analyze, Design and Build an Online Movie Ticket Sales System".

In project 1, I went into the analysis of the online movie ticket sales system. From surveying the old system, giving advantages and disadvantages to overcome the new system, building more advanced functions that are not available in other systems, managing large data volumes when managing capacity movie screenings, revenue and all other activities for many cinemas rather than a single cinema like previous systems did.

Coming to software project 2, I started building the system. And now I have completed the above two projects and also my scientific research. The project has been deployed and you can experience it in the **About** section.

It is also quite complete in terms of the basic functions required of an online movie ticket sales system such as: **Book tickets**, **Cancel tickets**, ... There are still some functions I can't do right now are: **Online payment**, **Support consulting**, ...

And in reality, creating a project like this requires a lot of human resources and is divided into stages, so with this research I only did it alone, so it's just my own experience. So it will take a long time to implement, but I will try my best to accomplish what I cherish.

This is the final class diagram that I have designed. It may be necessary to edit it after the software is improved.
